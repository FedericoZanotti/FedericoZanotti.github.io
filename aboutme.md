subtitle: Little Description of myself
---

My name is Federico Zanotti, I'm a computer engineer and data scientist. I graduated from the University of Bologna (Computer Engineering) and the University of Padova (Data Science).
I have always been interested in Artificial Intelligence because I think that is fascinating to explore the past to predict the future. In fact, in the last year of High School, I had to prepare a thesis, and I talked about Artificial Intelligence. For this reason today I'm a Data Scientist with curricula specialized in Machine Learning.
Moreover, at the current time, I am the president of the Par Tot A.S., a non-profit sports association, whose principal activity is spreading the Tchoukball, a sport with no physic contact and inspired to handball.
