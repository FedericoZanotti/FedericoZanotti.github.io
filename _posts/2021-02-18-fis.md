# FIFA19 Application

**Source Code**: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/FedericoZanotti/FIFA19_analysis/blob/master/FIS_Project_FIFA19.ipynb)

In this project my colleagues and I analyzed and created an interactive application for the FIFA 19 players dataset using Python for the course _Fondumental of Information System_. 
In particular the task was to create: 
1. An interactive application that takes two-player names as input and produces a visualization to compare their attributes. 
2. An application that takes the name of a team as input and produces a visualization comparing the players in terms of an attribute of choice. The attribute can be an input or can be selected interactively.
3. A visualization (possibly interactive) that compares the top 20 clubs in terms of the average overall value grouped by player position (goalkeeper, defensor, etc.). 

My principal efforts were done on the point 3 of the project, whith a supervision of the entire project. It was the first project of the Data Science Master, it was 
interesting and quite easy.
